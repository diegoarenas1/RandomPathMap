# Background
Hi! I'm Diego and I am an avid runner. Lately, I've been having trouble finding new and interesting routes, so I wrote this program to generate random running paths!

# Getting Started
You are going to need to do 2 things to use this program: enter your starting coordinates and get an API key for Google Maps API's (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)

# Thanks for looking!
If you have any suggestions or feedback, I would love to hear them! This is just a minimum viable product right now, but I enjoyed working on it and hope to make it bigger and better.
